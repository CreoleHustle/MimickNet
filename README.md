The above is a cineloop of cardiac data with conventional delay-and-sum beamforming and [ReFoCUS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8580195) beamforming. We apply clinical-grade post-processing, MimickNet post-processing, and show the unscaled difference between the two.

## Quick Start
## You can use the model immediately in [this google colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R_ARqpWoiHcUQWg1Fxwyx-ZkLi0IZ5qs)

The model from the paper is provided as `mimicknet_legacy.h5`. We also provide a luminance adjusted version with fewer weights with `mimicknet_1568473738-210304.h5` and `padded_mimicknet_1568473738-210304.h5`. The `padded` prefix allows for padding to be apart of the model, so no 16 padding logic is required. However, the layer used is incompatible with matlab, thus the matlab version has no pre-padding.

The `mimicknet_phantom_verasonics.h5` models were generated with only phantom data from verasonics.

A notebook and sample data is provided under `examples` for use in the following environments:
 - [`matlab`](https://github.com/Ouwen/MimickNet/blob/master/examples/matlab_example_2019a.m)

[Dr. Mark Palmeri's](https://github.com/mlp6) liver and kidney images are provided as test examples (Thanks Mark!)

## Metrics
| Model All            | SSIM          | PSNR          |
| ---------------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| MimickNet (BlackBox) | 0.94 ± 0.014  | 31.95 ± 2.04  |
| GrayBox              | 0.96 ± 0.012  | 32.86 ± 1.82  |
| MimickNet Phantom    | 0.95 ± 0.007  | 33.50 ± 1.43  |
| MimickNet Mark       | 0.96 ± 0.005  | 33.12 ± 0.92  |

Results above used non-public invivio + phantom data. 
Testing is on non-public invivo + phantom data.
MimickNet Mark are results only on Mark's liver/cardiac data.
MimickNet Phantom are results only on the public phantom data test split.

| Model Phantom     | SSIM          | PSNR          |
| ----------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| MimickNet Phantom | 0.90 ± 0.015  | 31.40 ± 2.76  |
| MimickNet Mark    | 0.91 ± 0.005  | 31.43 ± 0.69  |

Results above used only public phantom data for training.
MimickNet Phantom are results only on the public phantom data test data.
MimickNet Mark are results only on Mark's liver/cardiac data.

## Training the model from scratch
The following repo was designed to be run in Google Cloud and makes use of GCS for logging.
```
python3 -m trainer.blackbox_task
```
Different hyperparameters can be selected. Different tasks are shown in the root directory of the `trainer`. `blackbox_task.py`, and `graybox_task.py` are for running the blackbox and graybox tasks in the paper: [MimickNet, Matching Clinical Post-Processing Under Realistic Black-Box Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05782). `blackbox_paper_v1.py`, is the exact code run for the first release.

### Train the model in docker
To train this repo within a docker container, first clone the repo and run the following command in the root directory.
```
docker build -t mimicknet:latest .
```
Then you can run the docker container with the following command
```
docker run -it mimicknet:latest
```
If you have GPUs you can run docker with the `--gpus` flag.

### Custom data
The current model uses the dataset loader found in `./trainer/utils/dataset.py`. This dataset takes in two lists from different domains `A` and `B`. The dataset returns elements which are 4D tensors. Each dimension represents `[batch, height, width, 1]`. You can create your own dataset class, it simply needs to return a 4D tensor, and count the total number of elements. See [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/overview) on how to use tensorflow datasets.
